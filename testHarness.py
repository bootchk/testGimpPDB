    To be used as data for testing.
    Data chosen is arbitrary, we only care that it exists with name 'foo'.
    Arbitrary: get from the current Gimp context.

    The object model, from GIMP App Ref Manual:
    GimpData
        GimpBrush
            GimpBrushClipboard
            GimpBrushGenerated
            GimpBrushPipe
        GimpCurve
        GimpDynamics
        GimpGradient
        GimpPalette
        GimpPattern
            GimpPatternClipboard
        GimpToolPreset
    GimpBuffer
    GimpItem

    Most of these kinds are GimpData

    Kinds:
    palette
    gradient
    pattern ? API is different
    named buffer
    font ?

    We use 'foo' as a string type parameter whenever one is needed,
    and the use is often as the name of a kind of Gimp object.

    Not all these Gimp objects have Gimp classes.
