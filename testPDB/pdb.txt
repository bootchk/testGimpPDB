If the sample_merged parameter is TRUE, the data of the composite image will be used instead of that for the specified drawables. This is equivalent to sampling for colors after merging all visible layers. In the case of a merged sampling, the supplied drawables are ignored."

Layer masks serve as an additional alpha channel for a layer. Different types of masks are allowed for initialisation:
- white mask (leaves the layer fully visible);
- black mask (gives the layer complete transparency);
- the layer's alpha channel (either a copy, or a transfer, which leaves the layer fully visible, but which may be more useful than a white mask);
- the current selection;
- a grayscale copy of the layer;
- or a copy of the active channel.

The layer mask still needs to be added to the layer. This can be done with a call to 'gimp-layer-add-mask'.

'gimp-layer-create-mask' will fail if there are no active channels on the image, when called with 'ADD-CHANNEL-MASK'. It will return a black mask when called with 'ADD-ALPHA-MASK' or 'ADD-ALPHA-TRANSFER-MASK' on a layer with no alpha channels, or with 'ADD-SELECTION-MASK' when there is no selection on the image."

The idea behind this filter is to give the look of a photocopied version of the image, with toner transferred based on the relative darkness of a particular region. This is achieved by darkening areas of the image which are measured to be darker than a neighborhood average and setting other pixels to white. In this way, sufficiently large shifts in intensity are darkened to black. The rate at which they are darkened to black is determined by the second pct_black parameter. The mask_radius parameter controls the size of the pixel neighborhood over which the average intensity is computed and then compared to each pixel in the neighborhood to decide whether or not to darken it to black. Large values for mask_radius result in very thick black areas bordering the regions of white and much less detail for black areas everywhere including inside regions of color. Small values result in
less toner overall and more detail everywhere. Small values for the pct_black make the blend from the white regions to the black border lines smoother and the toner regions themselves thinner and less noticeable; larger values achieve the opposite effect."

If there is no selection or the item is not a drawable, the entire item will be flipped around the specified axis.

The idea behind this filter is to give the look of a black felt pen drawing subsequently shaded with color. This is achieved by darkening areas of the image which are measured to be darker than a neighborhood average. In this way, sufficiently large shifts in intensity are darkened to black. The rate at which they are darkened to black is determined by the second pct_black parameter. The mask_radius parameter controls the size of the pixel neighborhood over which the average intensity is computed and then compared to each pixel in the neighborhood to decide whether or not to darken it to black. Large values for mask_radius result in very thick black areas bordering the shaded regions of color and much less detail for black areas everywhere including inside regions of color. Small values result in more subtle pen strokes and detail everywhere. Small values for the pct_black make the
blend from the color regions to the black border lines smoother and the lines themselves thinner and less noticeable; larger values achieve the opposite effect."

'gimp-image-undo-freeze' / 'gimp-image-undo-thaw' and 'gimp-image-undo-disable' / 'gimp-image-undo-enable' differ in that the former does not free up all undo steps when undo is thawed, so is more suited to interactive in-situ previews.

The 4 coordinates specify the new locations of each corner of the original bounding box. By specifying these values, any affine transformation (rotation, scaling, translation) can be affected. Additionally, these values can be specified such that the resulting transformed item will appear to have been projected via a perspective transform.

If a selection exists and the item is a drawable, the portion of the drawable which lies under the selection is cut from the drawable and made into a floating selection which is then transformed as specified. The return value is the ID of the transformed floating selection.

If there is no selection or the item is not a drawable, the entire item will be transformed according to the specified mapping. Additionally, if the item has its linked flag set to TRUE, all additional items contained in the image which have the linked flag set to TRUE will also be transformed the same way. The return value will be equal to the item ID supplied as input.

The sample colors are sorted by brightness (== intentisty) and amount and stored in a sample colortable (where brightness is the index) The pixels of the destination layer are remapped with the help of the sample colortable. If use_subcolors is TRUE, the remapping process uses all sample colors of the corresponding brightness-intensity and distributes the subcolors according to their amount in the sample (If the sample has 5 green, 3 yellow, and 1 red pixel of the  intensity value 105, the destination pixels at intensity value 105 are randomly painted in green, yellow and red in a relation of 5:3:1 If use_subcolors is FALSE only one sample color per intensity is used. (green will be used in this example) The brightness intensity value is transformed at the remapping process according to the levels: out_lo, out_hi, in_lo, in_high and gamma The in_low / in_high levels specify an initial mapping of the intensity. The gamma value determines how intensities are interpolated between the in_lo and in_high levels. A gamma value of 1.0 results in linear interpolation. Higher gamma values results in more high-level intensities Lower gamma values results in more low-level intensities The out_low/out_high levels constrain the resulting intensity index The intensity index is used to pick the corresponding color in the sample colortable. If hold_inten is FALSE the picked color is used 1:1 as resulting remap_color. If hold_inten is TRUE The brightness of the picked color is adjusted back to the original intensity value (only hue and saturation are taken from the picked sample color) (or to the input level, if orig_inten is set FALSE) Works on both Grayscale and RGB image with/without alpha channel.
